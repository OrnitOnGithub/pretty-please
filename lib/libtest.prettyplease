/ this library makes the interpreter sadder when imported !
/ it also defines test = 17 !
/ please !
define me a variable test = 17 !
/ and a macro defvar !
define me a function defvar returning define me a variable \0 = \1 !
/ I truly hate you !
/ I absolutely hate you !
/ I HATE you !
/ You are the worst interpreter ever !
"give up" !
/ the thing is, it deletes the variables after defining them !
