# Guidelines

- Do not modify the structure of the project. You should mostly only be changing the main match-case tree.
- Try to write at least half-decently
  - Somewhat comment 
  - No variables like `x`, `i`, `index`... try to be a bit more descriptive
- Every change you add, you MUST document it in the README. Keep the README up to date.
- have fun. Other than this, nothing is off limits.
