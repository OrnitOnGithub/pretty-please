*pretty-please* is a groundbreaking interpreted programming language!

- ðŸ”® The future of programming
- ðŸš€ Written in Python
- ðŸ˜Ž Easy to learn
- ðŸ™‚ Sentient

## Run it!

edit `test.prettyplease` ! <br>
run it !
```
python3 pretty-please.py
```

## Learn it!

*pretty-please* is super easy to learn! Everything you need to know is in this README!

### General shape

Instructions follow this structure:
```
opcode arg1 arg2 ... !
```

- `opcode` defines the instruction
- `args` are used by the interpret
- `!` ends the instruction

### comments
Comments start with a slash and end with an exclamation mark, just like every instruction. (Technically, `/` is the opcode here)
```
/ this is a comment !
dosomething!  / this is a comment !
```
Comments can help you make code clearer, but beware: **the interpret can read them**. If your comments are rude, you'll make it grumpier. The opposite applies as well.

### Hello World!

Writing a hello world program is stupidly simple!
```
helloworld!
```
There you go!

Make sure the compiler is happy. Otherwise it might say goobye world instead...
### testing

`test`: An instruction that does nothing relevant. Prints a small response in the terminal.
```
test
```

### REPL
Just use `repl!` to start a REPL.

### Errors

If something bad happens, you'll make the interpret sadder. Be careful.

### By the way,

If the interpret's mad at you there's a chance it will refuse to follow orders.
