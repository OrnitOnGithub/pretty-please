# Pretty Please Extension
I'll add this to the marketplace later.

Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for *pretty-please*! <br>
Includes
- (Very) basic syntax highlighting (keywords & comments)
- auto bracket closing


## Install manually (if no vscode marketplace)

You can install this extension through the vscode marketplace, but you can do so manually as well. You need to download the repository for this. https://github.com/OrnitOnGithub/pretty-please

To install manually you need to copy the extension into your vscode's extension folder.

To install this way on linux, you can run `install.sh` from the project's root directory, so you'd run:

```bash
cat vscode-extension/install.sh # Show what's in the script. Always check your scripts before running them!
```
```
chmod +x vscode-extension/install.sh && ./vscode-extension/install.sh
```
